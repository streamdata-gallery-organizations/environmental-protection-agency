description: The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or sometimes USEPA)
  is an agency of the U.S. federal government which was created for the purpose of
  protecting human health and the environment by writing and enforcing regulations
  based on laws passed by Congress. The EPA was proposed by President Richard Nixon
  and began operation on December 2, 1970, after Nixon signed an executive order.
  The order establishing the EPA was ratified by committee hearings in the House and
  Senate. The agency is led by its Administrator, who is appointed by the president
  and approved by Congress. The current administrator is Gina McCarthy. The EPA is
  not a Cabinet department, but the administrator is normally given cabinet rank.
